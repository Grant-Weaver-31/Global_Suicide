# Global Suicide

I retrieved data from Kaggle.com to observe trends in global suicide rates from 1985-2016 across several variables including countries, continents, gender, and age groups. We cleaned the data, identified relationships of interest, created meaningful graphs to observe trends, conducted statistical calculations, and performed a thorough analysis of our findings. Please check out  'Global_Suicide.ipynb' file to find my final data analysis and the steps I took to get there.

About the Project
Our team narrowed down our scope of years to 1990-2015. We chose to use our data to answer the following questions:

What are the global trends in suicide?
Does gender play a role in suicide?
Which age group falls victim to suicide most frequently?
What are the suicide trends in the US?
Overall, our team learned a great deal about the trends in global suicide rates across numerous variables from 1990 to 2015. However, some additional topics we would've liked to explore given more time are:

T-Test - why is there a significant difference in the number of suicides between males and females in the USA?
Human Development Index - there were several null values in the original source data; though this is a key metric when evaluating suicide.
The relationship between GDP and suicide rates.
The dataset gave us the "who" and "where." It would be interesting to explore more data that would help us to understand more of the ... "why?"
