# Global Suicide

I retrieved data from Kaggle.com to observe trends in global suicide rates from 1985-2016 across several variables including countries, continents, gender, and age groups. I cleaned the data, identified relationships of interest, created meaningful graphs to observe trends, conducted statistical calculations, and performed a thorough analysis of our findings. Please check out 'Global_Suicide.ipynb' file to find my final data analysis and the steps I took to get there.

## About the Project
I narrowed down the scope of years to 1990-2015. I chose to use the data to answer the following questions:

- What are the global trends in suicide?
- Does gender play a role in suicide?
- Which age group falls victim to suicide most frequently?
- What are the suicide trends in the US?
Overall, I learned a great deal about the trends in global suicide rates across numerous variables from 1990 to 2015. However, some additional topics I would've liked to explore given more time are:

- T-Test - why is there a significant difference in the number of suicides between males and females in the USA?
- Human Development Index - there were several null values in the original source data; though this is a key metric when evaluating suicide.
- The relationship between GDP and suicide rates.
- The dataset gave us the "who" and "where." It would be interesting to explore more data that would help us to understand more of the ... "why?"
